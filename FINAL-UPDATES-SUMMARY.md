## CRITICAL NEXT STEPS

### 1. Run the RLS Fix SQL Script

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** You MUST run this SQL script in Supabase for sharing and collections to work:

```bash
# Open Supabase Dashboard > SQL Editor
# Copy and paste the contents of: schema/fix-share-and-collection-rls.sql
# Click "Run"
```

This will:
- Allow users to create share links
- Allow users to add recipes to collections
- Fix the "row-level security policy" errors

### 2. Test Mobile Responsiveness

- Open the app on your phone
- Test the hamburger menu
- Try adding to a collection from a recipe
- Test the share button
- Try "Add to Home Screen" (PWA install)

### 3. Optional: Update Mock Data Prices

If you want the mock data to show realistic ZAR prices:
- See `schema/UPDATE-PRICES-TO-ZAR.md` for conversion rates
- Multiply USD prices by ~18 to get ZAR
- Or just enter new items with ZAR prices going forward
