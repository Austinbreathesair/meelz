# Mobile Responsive Implementation Guide

This document outlines the mobile responsiveness features implemented in the Meelz app.

## Key Features

### 1. Responsive Navigation

**Desktop (lg+):**
- Full horizontal navigation bar with all links visible
- Sign out button on the right
- No bottom navigation

**Mobile (<lg):**
- Hamburger menu that slides down when clicked
- Full navigation links in dropdown
- Bottom navigation bar with 4 main items (Pantry, Recipes, Shopping, Budget)
- Hidden on desktop using `lg:hidden`

**Implementation:**
- `components/ui/NavBar.tsx` - Uses `useState` for mobile menu toggle
- `components/ui/BottomNav.tsx` - Shows on mobile only
- `app/(authed)/layout.tsx` - Conditionally hides BottomNav on desktop

### 2. Responsive Layout

**Pages:**
- All pages use `Page` component with responsive padding: `p-4 md:p-6`
- Page headers stack on mobile: `flex-col gap-3 sm:flex-row`

- Collection grids: Responsive columns that adapt to screen size

**Cards:**
- Full width on mobile, grid on desktop
- Image heights adjusted for mobile viewing

### 3. Typography

- Headings scale down on mobile: `text-2xl md:text-3xl`
- Logo scales: `text-xl md:text-2xl`
- Body text remains readable at all sizes

### 4. Buttons & Forms

- Buttons wrap on mobile: `flex flex-wrap gap-2`
- Form inputs stack vertically on small screens
- Touch-friendly sizes (min 44px height)

### 5. Recipe Detail Page

- Two-column grid on desktop: `grid md:grid-cols-2`
- Stacks on mobile for easy reading
